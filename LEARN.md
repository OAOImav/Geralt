# Learning

Geralt is a complex bot when it comes to functionality on Discord. You will need to know many concepts before jumping in and creating a bot just like Geralt. Or if you're going to just copy paste the entire bot without knowing what everything does.

## Concepts Required

In Python, you will be requiring the following concepts:
- basic python
  - data types, data structures, functions, etc.
- exception handling
- typing
- oop
- basics in asynchronous programming (better if you know this beforehand)
- decorators

When it comes to the data managment which is done by using PostgreSQL, you would be needing the following concepts:
- insert, delete, drop, select
- where clause
- on conflict

I dont use much complicated SQL for the entire bot, so it should be easy to learn.
