## Brief

A simple discord bot based on [**discord.py**](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/) API Wrapper. Named after the legendary protagonist [**Geralt of Rivia**](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia#:~:text=Geralt%20of%20Rivia%20was%20a%20legendary%20witcher%20of,tumultuous%20relationship%2C%20and%20became%20Ciri%20%27s%20adoptive%20father.). However, there are no commands related to the game or the series and the name for this bot came as I have a fond for the game and Geralt.

## Documentation

The website provides full details from A to Z regarding the bot. [**Click here**](https://bsod2528.github.io/Posts/Geralt/) to access it. All the commands, how to use them, how to setup the bot, etc. have been documented.
